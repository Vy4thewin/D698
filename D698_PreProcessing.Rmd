### Preprocessing Data

The Slope data set is a GIS created file with the shapefile of California provided by the 2022 Census. This shapefile was overlay with the slope geofile provided by the LANDFIRE 2020, which contain the geospatial slope data of California. In GIS, the shapefile way overlay with the slope data and a zonal statistic was performed to find the tract's average slope. The final product is provided with "slope" data set.

The zonal statistic was used in the vegetation type provided from the LANDFIRE 2022 Vegetation Type data set. The geo spatial data provided was used to find the zonal average vegetation for a Californian tract. This GIS Data set is represent by the "VegType" Data set.

For the climate data, NOAA Provided 2022's Average rainfall and weather (temperature) through their "Climate At A glance" dashboard. This data set is at the county level as it was the lowest level provided by the NOAA. For reference,

The team will need to combined all the feature data sets into one for the final combination with Fema's wildfire risk data set. The current change is dictating how the data sets will be binded and the operations performed to avoid over fitting.
