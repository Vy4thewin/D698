------ 10/21 update

A base data set is from the Wildfire risk assessment *might use only a few items as NRI has more data
https://www.fs.usda.gov/rds/archive/catalog/RDS-2020-0016

This data set provides the probability and logistic assessment of an area that is likely to burn, the potential the wildfire is difficult to control, the flame length probability

NRI also provides Wildfire Probability Data and a few land features. (enough data to do CA tracts only
https://hazards.fema.gov/nri/data-resources#csvDownload

combining with NRI Data set, need to map zipcodes to their tracts. Using US crosswalk data set to map zipcodes to their tracts (used 3rd quarter, 2022 Data set). Transform to only have zipcode, tract number, tract name. If mapping to NRI, map zips to "TRACTFIPS"
