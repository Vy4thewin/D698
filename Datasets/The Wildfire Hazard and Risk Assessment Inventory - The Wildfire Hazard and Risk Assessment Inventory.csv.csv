1,Wildfire Risk to Communities,United States,30,"The Wildfire Risk to Communities website contains interactive maps and graphs to help various municipal, county, and state agencies; land use planners; fire managers; and fire collaboratives better understand their communities' risk to wildfire and how to reduce it. The assessment was designed to compare wildfire risk across multiple communities rather than assess risk at a local scale. The methods largely follow Scott and others (2013). Fire modeling utilized a combination of FlamMap5 and FSim algorithms with input data from various national scale datasets (2014 LANDFIRE v. 1.4.0, 1985-2014 National Weather Service, 1992-2015 fire occurrence, and 2014-2020 U.S. Census Bureau). Data layers include (1) risk to potential structures, (2) conditional risk to potential structures, (3) exposure type, (4) burn probability, (5) conditional flame length, (6) flame length exceedance probabilities, and (7) wildfire hazard potential. All the data are available for download as raster layers on the wildfirerisk.org website under the Download tab.

2,Wildfire Hazard Potential for the United States,United States (3rd edition (2020) includes Alaska and Hawaii).,270,"The Wildfire Hazard Potential (WHP) for the United States dataset is a national index that quantifies the relative potential for a wildfire that may be difficult to control to identify where fuel treatments may be needed. The latest version (3rd edition) was released in 2020 and included data for Alaska and Hawaii. The WHP data were developed as part of the Wildfire Risk to Communities assessment (https://wildfirerisk.org). Versions released before 2014 were called Wildland Fire Potential (WFP) and covered the conterminous United States. The version of LANDFIRE data and date ranges of historical fire weather vary among the versions of the WHP data (see details below). All WHP versions utilized the FSim large fire simulator (Finney and others, 2011) with LANDFIRE vegetation and fuel data and historical wildfire point locations from the Fire Program Analysis Fire-Occurrence Database (FPA-FOD, Short 2017).  However, the vintage of the data and methods sometimes varied slightly among the WHP versions. Outputs combined FSim burn probability and fire intensity into two forms: 1) continuous integer values and 2) five WHP classes of very low, low, moderate, high, and very high. The WHP dataset does not consider assets or resources and does not portray threats or risks to any values. However, the dataset can be used alongside valued assets and resource data to estimate their relative risk to wildfires.

However, it was designed for small-scale analyses rather than regional or national studies. Users can define study areas up to 12 million acres. The workflow of IFTDSS-QWRA follows the methodology presented by Scott and others (2013). Users can simulate wildfire (Landscape Burn Probability model), map values (Highly Valued Resources or Assets (HVRAs)) using reference data within IFTDSS, or data uploaded to the system, complete an exposure analysis, and complete a QWRA for their study area. These can be calculated for a single landscape or many landscapes to assess impacts from fuel treatments and other disturbances. The Landscape Burn Probability model utilizes the FlamMap (Finney, 2006) to model fire behavior.

5,BLM Fire Risk Assessment,Conterminous United States and Alaska,90,"The U.S. Bureau of Land Management produced the U.S. Bureau of Land Management Fire Risk Assessment for use in a Five-Year Fuels Program Allocation Plan. It covers the conterminous United States and Alaska and focuses on public lands managed by the U.S. Bureau of Land Management. The assessment aimed to identify areas whose values (people, property, for example) and resources (water, wildlife, for example) are most at risk of being negatively impacted by wildfire. This assessment uses the FSim algorithm (Finney and others, 2011) to model burn probability and fire intensity levels (Short and others, 2016). Historical fire data used to parameterize the FSim simulations ranged from 1970 to 2008. FSim simulations used the LANDFIRE 2012 v1.3.0 data. The assessment then utilized a Bayesian Belief Algorithm to determine where fuel management is likely needed across U.S. Bureau of Land Management lands to address fire risk. The primary values considered in this assessment were: (1) Wildland Urban Interface-Residential Developed Populated Areas (RDPA; Haas and others, 2013), (2) Altered Fire Regimes, (3) Invasives (that strongly influence fire cycles) (NLCD, Homer and others, 2016), (4) Juniper (Juniperus sp.) and Pinon (Pinus sp.) Expansion (U.S. Bureau of Land Management, National Operations Center). All the source data, intermediate data, prepared inputs, and final outputs are under the GIS data tab in the ESRI StoryMap and available through ArcGIS online (search for U.S. Bureau of Land Management and fire).

6,National Wildfire Risk Assessment for Forest Service Lands,Conterminous United States,270,"The U.S. Forest Service completed the National Wildfire Risk Assessment for Forest Service lands in 2017 using methods from Scott and others. (2013), Scott and Thompson (2015), and Thompson and others (2016) to help inform national-level decisions about wildfire policy and resource allocation. Dillon (2020) provides additional insight into the methodology used for the project. The primary components of this project included wildfire simulation, highly valued resources and assets characterization, and an effects analysis. The model used to simulate wildfires is not stated in the National Wildfire Risk Assessment documentation, but Scott and others (2013) mentioned FSPro, FSim, and FlamMap5. The values considered in this assessment are: 1) communities, 2) infrastructure, 3) surface drinking water, 4) ecosystem function, and 5) air quality. These are then broken out into sub-categories and are assigned weighting factors. The effects analysis outputs included wildfire risk metrics such as conditional Net Value Change and expected Net Value Change.

7,USFS Firesheds and Fireshed Registry,Conterminous United States,270,"The U.S. Forest Service developed the Firesheds and Fireshed Registry Portal to delineate where fires ignite and are likely to spread to communities and expose buildings. This assessment created 7,688 firesheds within the conterminous United States by dividing the landscape into regular-sized units that represent similar source levels of community exposure to wildfire based on FSim simulated wildfire perimeters (Ager and others, 2021; Finney and others, 2011; Short and others, 2020). This assessment focused primarily on fuel management and wildfire treatment strategies and how these strategies can help protect communities and their property.  U.S. Forest Service ArcGIS Online account holders can access the data through an online portal/dashboard, and the public can view information through an ArcGIS online map.  The dashboard has five main tabs that allow users to determine (1) how exposure varies among ownerships, (2) how much of a landscape has been burned or treated in the recent past, (3) the spatial patterns of exposure in developed areas including plausible extreme fire events, (4) where future management efforts are planned, and (5) how are communities exposed to extreme fire events.

8,First Street Foundation Wildfire Model,Conterminous United States,30,"The First Street Foundation Wildfire Model estimates wildfire exposure at a property-by-property scale across the conterminous United States at a 30-m resolution.  This assessment defined property-level risk as the probability that a property experienced a wildfire.  Aggregated property-level risk for infrastructure, commercial properties, and social facilities provides community-level risk measures. This risk assessment is unique because it is commercial but built from Federally funded wildfire models and datasets.  Their analysis approach is similar to Finney and others (2011) and Thompson and others (2011) but at 30-m resolution.  This assessment used LANDFIRE v2.0.0 (2016) data and mapped the wildland-urban interface (WUI) using National Land Cover Data (Homer and others, 2020) and building footprints.  The assessment replaced non-burnable WUI vegetation with custom WUI fuel models.  It used the ELMFIRE model to generate wildfire simulations using historical weather data from 2011 – 2020 and downscaled climate projection ensembles from 2048 – 2057 and assessed risk using both building footprints and parcels (Kearns and others, 2022).

9,Federal Emergency Management Agency National Risk Index: Wildfire,Conterminous United States,270,"The Federal Emergency Management Agency compiled the National Risk Index to help identify U.S. communities most at risk for 18 natural hazards, including wildfires. The index was designed to help communities understand their risk for natural hazards, update emergency plans, allocate resources, educate community members, and identify needs for more refined risk assessments. This assessment used wildfire events data from 1996-2019 to calculate a historical loss ratio, which is the average rate of loss associated with a wildfire occurrence in each location. Then, wildfire risk and potential loss were calculated by combining the loss rates with population and agricultural data and 270-m resolution FSim-generated burn probability and flame length predictions (Finney and others, 2011; Short and others, 2016) to determine communities' vulnerability to wildfires.  This assessment is unique because it considers social vulnerability and community resilience in risk calculations. The assessment generated risk indices for Census tracts and counties.  This report and the data used are available to the public on FEMA's website.

Several government agencies (the 13 state forestry agencies, U.S. Forest Service Region 8, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Southeast Region, the Bureau of Indian Affairs Eastern and Southern Plains Regions, and the National Park Service) and the LANDFIRE program worked together to complete this assessment spanning 13 southern states: Alabama, Arkansas, North and South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Tennessee, Texas, and Virginia. The wildfire ignition density occurrence model measured the number of historical fires per year per 1000 acres based on historic wildfire ignition locations collected over six years (1997 - 2002) from federal, state, and local fire departments (Texas and Florida data vary slightly). The model utilized the Rothermel (1972) surface fire spread model to compute surface fire behavior characteristics based on surface fuel types. The primary value considered in this assessment was the wildland-urban interface, specifically housing density (number of houses per acre). These data came from the Where People Live Dataset and the 2012 LandScan population count data. The data used and created in this assessment is accessible through the public viewer (Southern Group of State Foresters Wildfire Risk Assessment Portal - Public Viewer, southernwildfirerisk.com).

22,Montana Wildfire Risk Assessment,Montana,120,"The Montana Wildfire Risk Assessment was published on May 8, 2020.  This assessment followed a similar methodology as the Southern Sierra Nevada, Chugach All-Lands, and the Pacific Northwest Wildfire Risk Assessments.  The goal of the assessment was to provide information about wildfire hazard and risk to highly valued resources and assets (HVRAs) across the state and considered several components of wildfire risk, including the likelihood of a wildfire occurring, the intensity of a wildfire if one were to burn, the exposure of HVRAs based on their locations, and the susceptibility of those resources and assets to wildfires.  In addition, a 60 km buffer was added around the state to account for wildfires ignited outside the state and burning into it.  This ensured that the observed and simulated wildfire sizes matched.  This assessment utilized the FSim large-fire simulator (Finney and others, 2011) using surface fuels, weather, topography, and historical wildfire occurrence data to produce the burn probability outputs.  The LANDFIRE Remap 2016 v2.0.0 data represented vegetation and fuels.  The Short (2017) Fire Occurrence Database (FOD; 1992-2017) provided historical wildfire occurrence.  Two data sources provided historical weather data: several remote automatic weather stations (RAWS) and the ERC (energy release component) from gridded ERC rasters.  The number of simulations varied between 10,000 and 20,000 iterations depending on the fire occurrence area (FOA).  Simulation outputs have 120-m pixel resolution.  The values considered in this assessment (HVRAs) included people and property, infrastructure, and surface drinking water.  Each HVRA was assigned a weight to calculate a combined risk index: people and property (60% weight), infrastructure (25%), and surface drinking water (15%).

The assessment objectives were to (1) complete a wildfire risk analysis that identifies where wildfire is expected to produce the greatest loss to Sage Grouse and other fire-affected resources and where fire can generate ecosystem benefits, and (2) identify strategic locations for fuels treatments that reduce risk to Sage-grouse while considering fire affected resources and maximizing return on investment in the northern Great Basin. The assessment used STARFire, a spatial fire planning and budget system developed in collaboration with the U.S. Department of Interior National Park Service (NPS), Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS), and the Bureau of Land Management at the WESTFIRE Research Center at Colorado State University. STARFire was applied across the state of Idaho for this assessment (Rideout and others, 2014), but STARFire has also been applied nationally (Wei and others, 2016). Rideout and others, (2019) provides details about the STARFire approach. STARFire utilized FlamMap to estimate fire behavior for different National Fire Danger Rating Areas using weather conditions and fuel moistures from representative weather stations, LANDFIRE fuels (v.1.3.0, 2012), and fire and ignition history (Short 2015). Fire-affected resources were identified by U.S. Bureau of Land Management district resource managers, and subject matter experts provided resource data and defined response curves linking flame length to resource values using the non-market and non-monetized Marginal Attributes of Substitution (MARS) economic valuation system known (Rideout et al. 2008). STARFire also incorporates treatment costs, defined by treatment type, fuel model, and land status (degraded or intact), and initial attack ability (preparedness) based on distance to dispatch locations and rate of spread. STARFire uses a single metric to assess the risks and benefits of wildfire: return on investment (ROI) and includes functionality to assess risks and benefits of wildfire, fuel treatment locations, and preparedness levels. In this assessment, STARFire was used to provide an initial wildfire risk assessment for all of Idaho as well as a fuel treatment assessment to generate an ROI surface and identify areas where fuel treatments would generate a greater ROI.

32,Chugach All-Lands Wildfire Risk Assessment,"South Central Alaska: Chugach National Forest area, including the Kenai Peninsula. ",120,"The Chugach All-Lands Wildfire Risk Assessment, published on June 30, 2021, was prepared for the U.S. Forest Service Region 10 to provide foundational information about wildfire hazards and risks to highly valued resources and assets (HVRA) for the Chugach National Forest and surrounding areas in Southcentral Alaska. This assessment considered several components of wildfire risk, including the likelihood of fire occurrence, conditional fire intensity, exposure of highly valuable resources and assets (HVRAs), and the susceptibility of those resources and assets to damage from wildfires. This assessment used burn probabilities calculated from 100,000 120-m FSim large-fire simulations (Finney and others, 2011) based on surface fuels, weather, topography, and historical wildfire occurrence data. The FSim simulations used fuel models and information from the LANDFIRE fuels data (2014 v1.4.0) and data from the Kenai Vegetation Mapping Project, revised to include a custom burnable model for developed areas and to account for disturbances occurring between 2015 and 2019. Additional inputs to the fire spread simulations included historical wildfire occurrences for fires 100 acres or larger (Short, 2017; 1992-2015) and historical weather data from four Remote Automatic Weather Stations (RAWS) stations. The values considered in this assessment included people and property, infrastructure, carbon credits, and drinking water. These were combined based on their relative importance: people and property 69%, infrastructure 14%, water 11%, and carbon 6%.

35,Southern Sierra Nevada Wildfire Risk Assessment,"24 million acres in Southern Sierra Nevada covering the Inyo, Sierra, and Sequoia National Forests. ",90,"The Southern Sierra Nevada Wildfire Risk Assessment was prepared for the USDA Forest Service, Region 5, and was published on April 30, 2015. The assessment sought to determine areas with the highest wildfire risk to communities and natural resources and to determine areas that could potentially benefit from wildfires. The analysis covers three national forests: the Inyo, Sierra, and Sequoia. The analysis considered multiple values at risk, including human habitation (wildland-urban interface), inholdings, major infrastructure (power plants & communication towers, etc.), recreation and administrative infrastructure (forest service campgrounds and structures), visual resources (scenic byways), critical terrestrial habitat, timber resources, watershed resources, and vegetation condition. The assessment used historical fire occurrence (Short 2014) summaries for eight different fire occurrence areas within the Southern Sierra Nevada landscape based on elevation-based ecozones. The fuelscape (virtual landscape on which wildfires were simulated) data were created from the 2008 v1.1.0 LANDFIRE total fuel change dataset and considered elevation, slope, aspect, surface fuel, canopy cover, canopy height, crown base height, and crown bulk density. The assessment also used weather data from four remote automated weather stations (RAWS) to calculate the energy release component, dead fuel moisture content, and wind speed & direction data for each station. The assessment calculated burn probabilities at 180-m resolution FSim simulations (Finney and others, 2011) using the historical fire occurrence, fuelscape, and weather data.
